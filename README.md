# Clustering of Mall Customers Dataset

-> This project uses K-Means clustering to divide mall patrons into groups according to their gender, spending score, and yearly income. 
-> It makes use of the well-known Mall_Customers dataset and incorporates PCA-based dimensionality reduction, clustering, and data visualization.


## Dataset :
Source - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python



## Goals:

-> Clean and preprocess the data
-> Visualize the raw data
-> Cluster customers using KMeans
-> Use the elbow method to find the ideal number of clusters
-> Visualize clusters using PCA
-> Assess clustering using the Silhouette Score.


## Illustrations:

1. Raw Data Scatter Plot: Score for Annual Income versus Spending.


2. The Elbow Method Plot aids in figuring out K's ideal value.
   

3. PCA Cluster Visualization: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to visualize customer segments in 2D space.


## Techniques:

-> Label Encoding (For Gender part)
-> Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and KMeans Clustering
-> The Silhouette Score is used to evaluate clusters.
